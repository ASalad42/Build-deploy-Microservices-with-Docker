- started docker desktop 
- `docker run hello-world`

Steps to go through in detail: 

 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
    show how
 
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
    show how 
 
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
    show how 
 
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.
    show how 

image to container behind the scenes:

- In a container a portion of each resource is made available to process  by the kernal

- file snapshot inside image taken and place inside segment od HD i.e hd with just chrome and python installed as shown above. 
- running process = startup command i.e run chrome for me
